Postemsg Package

Description:

This package executes the tasks performed by Tivoli Systems
postemsg executable in a platform independent manner. The
various TEC message slots can be set with setter methods.
The actual message is sent to TEC by first: performing an
emulated RPC call to obtain the port where the TEC wants to
talk and the setting up a TCP/IP connection to that port
to transmit the data.  This nut was cracket by purusing
AEF C code and sniffing the wire while using
postemsg from the command line.
